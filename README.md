### CSV Format 
The csv file should have at least the value: 
email

### Run 
To have more detail about the command run --help

Here is a example that should help you understand how it could be used:
`./minimailer.py --dry-run --subject 'Subject' -- name.csv 
' FirstName Name <email.used@to.send>' mail.txt.j2`

### SMTP Authentification 
I advise you to use app passwords for the authentification.
